# Changelog
Here we have a changelog, since we're now making changes to versions. This is the first one, hooray!

## v0.1.1
- Addressed issues brought up in issue #5
  - Removed "UMASK" environment variable
  - Added "DEEMIX_SINGLE_USER=true" environment variable to default deemix configuration. 
    - reasoning by @Bockiii - "as that will make the login serverwide (so you only need to login once in one browser and can use the same user in every session)"


## v0.1.0
First release.
